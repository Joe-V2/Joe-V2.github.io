# Repositories


## Interview Questions with Emojis
#### C++, Bitwise Operators, Nested Logic
The solutions to a few I've had from interviews so far, packed up as educational pieces aimed at beginners.     
The corresponding repository has all the specified functions written and ready to compile, but a header file with multiple `#define` statements is used to obfuscate things, away from prying eyes direct copying.

## Blue Mountain
#### Node.JS, JavaScript, CSS, Concurrency, IoT Messaging
A nice little watchface I made for my fitbit versa.
Sunrise and sunset are used to define the current time as a percentage of daylight remaining, and the sun turns to reflect this like a radial gauge as a result.
The sun changes to a moon at night, and the blue sky darkens and is filled with stars.
The moon even reflects the current phase of our one in the sky!

## Fatality Classifier
#### Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Automated Data Handling
A python notebook script I completed as part of my first class honours bachelors' degree. Throw in a csv file, install Python 3.7, pandas and scikit-learn, press play and watch it go!
The program itself predicts whether or not a patient is at immediate risk of cardiac mortality, based on a mix of patient family history, contralesional and ipsilesional scores, experiences of diabeties, hypertension and arrythmias.  
Everything from taxonomy and cleaning to modelling and accuracy comparison is fully automated, and spits everything out as a CSV at the end - great for making your own graphs to show the board.  
It does only work on the data that follows the headings in the accompanying CSV and trains on a 70-30 split, but with some more work, I don't see any reason why it couldn't do it for any CSV by abstracting the headings - that's the only thing holding it back!
