## Tanks: A Multiplayer Top-Down Shooter   
#### C#, Unity, Game Mechanics   
A top-down tank shooting game that supports one to four players at a time, using Xbox 360 controllers for input. Each player has a unique colour, which is passed into all sprites associated with their tank - and a unique horn sound, for honking and taunting other players. The game relies on a player using powerups to eliminate enemy tanks to score points, which are rendered as grey sprites controlled by an AI, using a linked list of navigation nodes. In the interests of balance, players may shoot one bullet at a time, being able to fire again when it has embedded itself in a wall or an enemy - and all powerups wear off after twelve seconds, or upon a player's death.      
   
Available powerups include:    
- Mines - lay up to five at a time before the buff wears off!    
- Bouncing bullets - vector maths and reflections make your bullets bounce, up to a maximum of five times.   
- Power bullets - shoot the terrain to blow holes in the enemy cover walls!   
- Multi shot - fire two bullets at a time, instead of just the one.

## JavaScript Data Visualisation  
#### JavaScript, D3.js  
A couple of graphs I made for the visualisation module of my Computer Science Bachelor's.  
Whilst the demo data in the radar chart is intrinsic to its HTML accompaniment, the LHOC chart reads from a csv instead.    
You can hover your mouse over the regions in the radar chart, or try scrolling/zooming into the LHOC graph for even more fun - mathematical!

## Interview Questions with Emojis
#### C++, Bitwise Operators, Nested Logic
The solutions to a few questions I've had from interviews so far, packed up as educational pieces aimed at beginners.     
The corresponding repository has all the specified functions written and ready to compile, but a header file with multiple `#define` statements is used to obfuscate things, away from prying eyes direct copying.

## Blue Mountain
#### Node.JS, JavaScript, CSS, Concurrency, IoT Messaging
A nice little watchface I made for my fitbit versa.
Sunrise and sunset are used to define the current time as a percentage of daylight remaining, and the sun turns to reflect this like a radial gauge as a result.
The sun changes to a moon at night, and the blue sky darkens and is filled with stars.
The moon even reflects the current phase of our one in the sky!

## Fatality Classifier
#### Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Automated Data Handling
A python notebook script I completed as part of my first class honours bachelors' degree. Throw in a csv file, install Python 3.7, pandas and scikit-learn, press play and watch it go!
The program itself predicts whether or not a patient is at immediate risk of cardiac mortality, based on a mix of patient family history, contralesional and ipsilesional scores, experiences of diabeties, hypertension and arrythmias.  
Everything from taxonomy and cleaning to modelling and accuracy comparison is fully automated, and spits everything out as a CSV at the end - great for making your own graphs to show the board.  
It does only work on the data that follows the headings in the accompanying CSV and trains on a 70-30 split, but with some more work, I don't see any reason why it couldn't do it for any CSV by abstracting the headings - that's the only thing holding it back!
